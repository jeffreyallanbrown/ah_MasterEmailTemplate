## Overview


## Getting Started


## Considerations
All variables used in the template were set up with mktoModuleScope='true'. This makes it so that all variable-specific styling is restricted to that particular instance of the module, and not inherited by every module of the same type. This should be default functionality but we have to explicitly define it for now.
